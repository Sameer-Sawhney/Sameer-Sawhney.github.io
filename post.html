        <div class="container">

                    <p> After winning I.D.E.A'14 (Innovate Delhi Entrepreneurship Academy) for "SurfingCouch" - A global wifi lending system, it was quite apparent that I wanted to learn more about Startups and contribute to the startup ecosystem around Delhi.   
                    <p>I.D.E.A provided me a platform to explore the startup circle in and around Delhi. I visited quite a few startups in coming months and learnt about how different startups survive, grow and sometimes shut down in the tough times</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Learn by doing</h2>

                    <p>I wanted to challenge myself post I.D.E.A. With my decade long experience of working on some of the leading world class software products, I wanted to check if I can build a complete software platform from scratch.</p>

                    <p>Working full time as a Software manager, I took up the challenge and with help of IITD resources, I was able to assemble a team of young students who were eager to refine their software skills</p>
                    
                     <p>After 10 months of working on weekends, the team was able to build first version of a Social Media Analytics platform using open source technologies which got deployed at various organizations.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experience gave me enough confidence that with right team, building a world class software is a matter of time if efforts are put in right place.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the software platform we built was for non-commerical use, it was critical that I also learn about running a business. Hence, I decided to pursue my MBA after spending more than 10 years in software industry.</p>
                    
                    <p>With this new goal in mind, my MBA journey got kickstarted and in summar of 2018, I will be officially start this journey at Olin Business School at Washington University, St. Louis</p>

                    <p>I hope to utilize the next 2 years to sharpen my business knowledge and continue to experiment with my ideas and bring to life few of them ! Let's see what will happen but I am quite excited to start this new phase in my life.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
