                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p> After winning I.D.E.A. (Innovate Delhi Entrepreneurship Academy) organized by Stanford GSB it was quite apparent that I wanted to learn more about Startups and contribute to the startup ecosystem in and around Delhi.   
                   
                    
                    <p>Little had I known when I started, that an entrepreneurial program
would eventually prove to become my moment of epiphany. Revolutionary
ideas, motivating speeches, world-class speakers - it was an
incredibly vibrant atmosphere, and in many ways proved to be a
stimulus that led me in search of a new sphere of working where I
could independently bring tangibility to new ideas, and let the
entrepreneur in me shine. The program was about how to innovate and
find innovative solutions for challenging problems with technology and
                        build products for the future. </p>


<p>I returned home to find myself instilled with refreshing confidence
that I could be a successful entrepreneur one day. During the program,
I learnt about the end-to-end process of  venture design from Stanford
professors and entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley. Their experience on
topics such as the venture ecosystem, identifying market
opportunities, design thinking, MVP, scaling a startup, and leading a
venture was quite enriching. In the third week of program, we were
divided in small teams to create a complete venture plan consisting of
a market analysis, a mock up of the product, and a pitch to potential
investors. My team presented the idea of ‘Surfing Couch’, a technology
product to make global WiFi sharing possible. For 3 weeks, 24 hours a
day my ideas were challenged, and it felt exciting to be in the shoes
    of an entrepreneur. </p>


<!-- Amongst many inspiring experiences the interactions with Amit Ranjan
the COO of SlideShare was the one that motivated me the most. His
journey of taking a simple idea and developing a product used by
millions of users was truly inspiring. There were many instances that
made me realized that there is lot to learn about running a successful
technology enterprise and an MBA will surely help me reach my goals
quickly.</p> 
                    
                                         <h2 class="section-heading">Learn by doing</h2>

                    <p>I wanted to challenge myself post I.D.E.A. With my decade long experience of working on some of the leading world class software products, I wanted to check if I can build a complete software platform.</p>

                    <p>I took up this challenge and was able to assemble a team of young students who were eager to refine their software skills and build a Social Media Analytics software platform.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experience gave me enough confidence that with right team, building a world class software is a matter of time if efforts are put in right place.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the software platform was for non-commerical use, it was quite critical that I also learn more about running a successfull business. -->
                    
                    <p>I wanted to challenge myself post I.D.E.A so I decided to pursue my MBA to gain the necessary business skills. With this new goal in mind, my MBA journey got kickstarted. I am quite excited that I will officially start my journey soon in Fall'16 at Olin Business School at Washington University, St. Louis</p>

                    <p>I hope to utilize the next two years to sharpen my business knowledge and continue to experiment with my ideas and hopefully bring to life some of them ! I am quite excited to start this new phase of my life.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
