                    <p> Britain's vote to leave European Union will have long lasting implications on World's economy. Business leaders and Economists around the world have already started speculating short term as well as long term impact of this historical decision. The vote to exit EU came as a surprise  and will impact businesses and students who will be going out in the job market full of uncertainities.   
                   
                    
                    <p>The Pandora's box is now open and we have already started experiencing knee-jerk reaction to the Euro as well Stock markets around the globe. Trillion of dollars have already been lost in just 48 hours and it is just the beginning. As businesses will start to settle down in this new era of political and macroeconomic uncertainity, the consequences of this decision will be hard to predict.  </p>

                        
<p>Well the bigger question is whether it is justifiable that a such a small difference of votes ( 4% of Britons ~1,26,950) is enough to change the course of history when most of the Britons are frantically Googling what EU is after they have voted ? Only time will tell, how this decision will impact our lives but it certainly has shown the ugly side of Democracy. Leaving important decisions in hands of people who don't even understand the implications of it. </p>

<p> As I am going to embark upon my MBA journey in uncertain times, one thing is for certain that Brexit will be an interesting case study :) </p>


<!-- Amongst many inspiring experiences the interactions with Amit Ranjan
the COO of SlideShare was the one that motivated me the most. His
journey of taking a simple idea and developing a product used by
millions of users was truly inspiring. There were many instances that
made me realized that there is lot to learn about running a successful
technology enterprise and an MBA will surely help me reach my goals
quickly.</p> 
                    
                                         <h2 class="section-heading">Learn by doing</h2>

                    <p>I wanted to challenge myself post I.D.E.A. With my decade long experience of working on some of the leading world class software products, I wanted to check if I can build a complete software platform.</p>

                    <p>I took up this challenge and was able to assemble a team of young students who were eager to refine their software skills and build a Social Media Analytics software platform.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experience gave me enough confidence that with right team, building a world class software is a matter of time if efforts are put in right place.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the software platform was for non-commerical use, it was quite critical that I also learn more about running a successfull business. -->
                    
                    <p>I wanted to challenge myself post I.D.E.A so I decided to pursue my MBA to gain the necessary business skills. With this new goal in mind, my MBA journey got kickstarted. I am quite excited that I will officially start my journey soon in Fall'16 at Olin Business School at Washington University, St. Louis</p>

                    <p>I hope to utilize the next two years to sharpen my business knowledge and continue to experiment with my ideas and hopefully bring to life some of them ! I am quite excited to start this new phase of my life.</p>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
